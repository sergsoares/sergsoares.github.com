### Yet, Another SSG

To start my blog and learn a little more programming topics, start this static site generator.

Until now only simple commands.

To Build files inside /posts
```
$ npm run build
```

To develop i start using [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape), but after a lot of packages 
need be installed to work change to [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest).
```
$ npm run test 
```

To test templates inside project can be used NPM scripts to live-reload and build.
```
$ npm run dev
```

Extremely inspired on, I took advantage to trainning TDD in JS and start a project from zero:
